Hi,  
  
I'm a Computer Science Masters student. I'll be posting some questions about Algorithms, Data Structures, a bit of maths. Occasionally, these questions will be academically relevant. But you can bet these questions at some point were asked by interviewers when someone applies for a position at a software company.  
  
I plan to post the question, and post my immediate thoughts...I'll be updating my posts frequently improving upon my solutions. I may occasionally quote or refer to an external website and adapt their solutions. If the update is a complete redesign, I'll make a brand new post referring to the old one.  
  
I'll be using Java or Python for most of my code samples. I'll also upload most of it to my github account.  
  
This blog not strictly targeted for Computer Science students. Puzzle aficionados will enjoy them as much as they enjoy their daily sudoku. The code provided is just to prove the feasibility of the implementation.  

  

  
The subject of Algorithms is no doubt challenging but it will always surprise you with something new and the satisfaction of coming up with an efficient solution is very rewarding. So, lets begin. (...and wish me luck.)
