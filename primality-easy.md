This is an experimental post. I'm trying out [Scarky.com](http://scarky.com/). Seems promising, but we can't an create account and manage challenges. Apparently, I have to save this secret URL if I want to edit a challenge. VeryÂ inconvenient! :(  
  
I've created a simple programming challenge for my readers. If it's a hit, expect more.
